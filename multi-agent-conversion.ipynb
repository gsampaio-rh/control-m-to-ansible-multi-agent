    "# Multi-Agent Workflow for Control-M Job Conversion to Ansible Playbook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an automated multi-agent workflow that converts a Control-M job definition into an Ansible playbook. The workflow also performs linting, review, and validation of the generated playbook using multiple agents, ensuring it follows best practices. The process includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Job Conversion**: A Control-M job is converted into an Ansible playbook format.\n",
    "2. **Playbook Linting**: The playbook is checked for errors and inconsistencies using `ansible-lint`.\n",
    "3. **Playbook Review**: The playbook is reviewed and validated based on the original Control-M job.\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loop**: If the playbook fails the review, the workflow attempts to adjust and reconvert the job until it passes validation or reaches a defined limit of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook leverages `langgraph`, `RoleAgent`, and a multi-agent state graph to orchestrate the entire process, providing an efficient method to convert and validate automation jobs in a scalable and repeatable manner."
